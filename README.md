## Data

- XMM-OM SUSS

- 3XMM-DR8

## Software

- TOPCAT

## Usage

- luminosity.py

The main. Run it to group the source from the _fits_ file automatically. Check the _main_ part to derive the brevity luminosities (UV, X-ray), carry out linear fitting and so on.

- estimation.py

Sub-code for the $luminosity.py$, as stated in the top of the code.

- wash_fits.py

Sub-code for the $luminosity.py$, as stated in the top of the code.

- match.py

Sub-code for the $luminosity.py$, as stated in the top of the code.
